# Enter the desired SLO as a list. For error rate SLOs this should be a single elemnt list with percentage,
# usually between 99 to 99.999. For latency SLOs this should be a two element list. For example,
# for the SLO specification: "90% of the requests should be with latency less than 200 ms" the list
# will be [90, 200]. In addition, for latency SLOs be careful to enetr the latency threshold in ms
# or seconds, depends on the service/ metric. For example, ApiGateway Latency is in ms but
# ApplicationELB TargetResponseTime is in seconds

# example of error rate SLO:
# SLO: [99.9]

# examples of latency SLOs:
# ApiGateway latency SLO:
SLO: [99, 200]  # 99 % of the requests should be below 200 ms
# ApplicationELB latency SLO:
# SLO: [99, 0.2] # 99 % of the requests should be below 0.2 seconds
